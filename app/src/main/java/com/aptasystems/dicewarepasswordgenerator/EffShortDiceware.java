/**
 * This class uses one of the EFF "short" word list which is designed to include
 * the 1,296 most memorable and distinct words in the hope that this approach
 * might offer a usability improvement for longer passphrases. Passphrases
 * generated using the shorter lists will be weaker than the long list on a
 * per-word basis (10.3 bits/word).  Put another way, this means you would
 * need to choose more words from the short list, to get comparable security
 * to the long listâ€”for example, using eight words from the short will provide
 * a strength of about 82 bits, slightly stronger than six words from the long
 * list. Further study is needed to determine conclusively which list will
 * yield passphrases that are easier to remember.
